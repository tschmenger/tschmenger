# About me
Hello everyone!
I am working non-stop in wet-lab laboratories since 2009 where I started as a trained lab technician. I finished my PhD december 2022 in the group of [Prof. Rob Russell](http://russelllab.org). My job there included managing 'my own' laboratory, which includes supervising a permanent technical assistant & the occasional students.

# Research
My research focus lies on interrogating human health and disease & I try to use my insights and knowledge to answer questions related to this using wet-lab and dry-lab approaches. 

During my PhD I started to delve into **Python** and **R** and I try to moderate between the wet-lab point of view and the bioinformation point of view when approaching bioinformatics problems.
